    </ul>

      <li>125g ball mozzarella, sliced</li>
      <li>handful grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)</li>
      <li>handful of cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>To finish:</h3>

    <h2>Method:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Make the base</h3>
        <p>
          Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make
          a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together
          with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto
          a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover
          with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you
          like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Make the sauce</h3>
        <p>
          Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to
          taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with
          shaping the base.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Roll out the dough</h3>
        <p>
          if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into
          two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds,
          about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very
          thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured
          baking sheets.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Top and bake</h3>
        <p>
          heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an
          upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over
          bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes,
          drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking
          sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until
          crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using.
          Repeat step for remaining pizza.
